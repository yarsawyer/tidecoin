## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

### Preferred: GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting

Use GitHub's built-in private vulnerability reporting:

1. Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/tidecoin/tidecoin/security)
2. Click "Report a vulnerability"
3. Fill in the details

This is the fastest way to reach us and keeps the report confidential.

### Alternative: Encrypted Email

Send an email to **falcon1024@protonmail.com** (not for general support).

Proton Mail provides post-quantum encrypted email (ML-KEM + X25519).
If you are also using Proton Mail, end-to-end PQ encryption is automatic.
