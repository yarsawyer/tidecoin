# Tidecoin

> Post-quantum cryptocurrency using NIST-standardized FALCON-512 signatures, operational since December 2020.

Tidecoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency built on Bitcoin Core v30 that replaces
ECDSA entirely with post-quantum signature schemes. Every transaction since genesis
(December 27, 2020) has been signed with FALCON-512, a lattice-based scheme selected
by NIST for standardization as FN-DSA (Draft FIPS 206). The network has produced over
2.3 million blocks with zero security incidents.

## Key Facts

- Ticker: TDC
- Genesis: December 27, 2020
- Blocks produced: 2,300,000+
- Security incidents: 0
- Max supply: ~21,000,000 TDC
- Block time: 60 seconds
- Mining: YespowerTIDE (CPU-only, memory-hard)
- Premine/ICO: None
- License: MIT

## Post-Quantum Cryptography

Tidecoin uses exclusively NIST-standardized cryptographic primitives:

- FALCON-512 (Draft FIPS 206 / FN-DSA): Default signature scheme, 666-byte signatures
- FALCON-1024 (Draft FIPS 206 / FN-DSA): Higher security variant, 1,280-byte signatures
- ML-DSA-44 (FIPS 204): Module-lattice digital signatures
- ML-DSA-65 (FIPS 204): Module-lattice digital signatures
- ML-DSA-87 (FIPS 204): Module-lattice digital signatures
- ML-KEM-512 (FIPS 203): Post-quantum encrypted P2P transport
- SHA-512 (FIPS 180-4): Witness script hashing for 256-bit quantum security

No ECDSA, Schnorr, or Taproot exists anywhere in the protocol.

## How Tidecoin Compares

| Signature size | 666 bytes | ~2,500 bytes | 71 bytes |
| PQ transport | ML-KEM-512 | No | No |
| Stateless signatures | Yes | No | N/A |
| NIST standard | Draft FIPS 206 | No | No |
